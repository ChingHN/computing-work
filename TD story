Standing on the very top of the hill was a deserted mansion--no--a haunted mansion.The twins could only clamber up the hill in order to reach the meeting spot.As weird as it seemed,the twins kew better than to go against their father,but the destination and meeting time was unsetting."H-hey,so do you t-think that h-he will show up?"Kyoka muttered,swinging herself up a rocky ledge using the overhanging branch."It does seem quite strange since Father was never the type to evem show up.That jerk abandoned us and even when we called him to come home whe Mother was sick and fell ill,he merely sent a "Sorry".The most outraging shit was that according to Melissa who was abroad,she saw Father dating another woman.Don't tell me she saw the wrong man,we hung out since we were 3,she knows our family well enough,'Karma spat,glaring at Kyoka who wanted to protest.He knew that his sister was a softie and her compassion was overwhelming,even too much at times."10 years later,he comes back to apologise in a shit house.I'll make use of that advantage in the abandoned house.Just you see,sis,I'll have him on his knees in no time."
When the duo clambered to the top of the hill,they saw a 3-floored mansion that stood with ripe dominance.The mansion was made purely of ivory and marble,vines curling up the floors with rusting frames and smashed windows.Kyoka knew very well that Karma would start scouting around the mansion to find the old jerk first.Unfortunately,Karma was not joking about bringing him onto his knees.All this while,Karma had to relinquish his anger on the job,assasinating his targets as cruelly as possible.When faced with his true target,Kyoka has no doubts that he will go straight for hellish torture then the most "artistic" kill.That was the only way to vent his anger rationally and Kyoka could not help him much.She,too, was angry at their old man for his ridiculoius behaviour,but the tiny voice inside her still hopes that this is nothing more than a nightmare...
Karma,who graduated from the assasination class,was obvious;y skilled at hunting and assasination.He came back,signalling his hands in a cross--the old man is inside.He brandished his assasination weapon--a knife--while Kyoka took a flashlight out from her satchel."Don't do that!"Karma hissed,yanking the torchlight and threw it down the mountain."I forgot to teach you the first rule in assasination:always scout your enemies in the dark.You get the surprise factor and attention won't be drawn to you."Karma sighed,fishing out 2 night vision goggles.Kyoka pouted,"At least you ould have said so...you threw my new torchlight down the hill!Who knows if it's still in one piece..."The duo stalked up to the front gates and pushed the door open.Unfortunately,as cunning as the man ever was,he set traps to alert him of their arrival.The front door not only let out a stubborn creak,he added bells to the top of the door.Karma jumped to the top and slashed at the bells,emitting a long chime.He yelled,"Enough with your party tricks!Come out and play!"Kyoka was about to warn him about the laser traps when Karma deftly leapt over the laser traps like a gymnast."Well,come on!"Kyoka tried to follow his moves but ended up sticking to the ground,sliding across the marble flooring to get to the other side of the hall.
When they reached the other side of the hall,they reached a long hallway with two rows of stairs leading up to different corners of the mansion.Kyoka couldn't put her finger on why the house looked oddly familiar and glanced at Karma,who appeared to have made the same conclusion.Karma then fished out a device which had an antennae on the top with radars scanning nearby surroundings."I placed a tracker on his beloved pocket watch before he ran away to date another woman.That slime grim carries that everywhere he goes."Karma sneered as he set the radar on the floor.Kyoka walked around and found a carpet on the floor.It showed a lady dressed in ancient greek clothes,holding a bowl and her arm raised,pointing towards the left set of stairs."The bastard is on the left side."Karma picked up his radar and stomped up the stairs two at a time,Kyoka following suit.The reached a circular room which led to four doors.Kyoka brandished her dagger from the hidden pouch behind her back and inspected the doors.The first door on the left had rusty hinges,but the frame was in a poor condition.Definitely not where the old creep is.The second door looked the same,except that the rust on the hinges weren't as bad as the first.There was a potrait of a lady on the door,smelling a bouquet of flowers.That looked a lot like the lady in the jerk's pocket watch.Now that she thought of it,the lady on the carpet looked like this lady......could it be that jerk's new wife?A clack came from behind the door as Kyoka was about to move onto the next door.The said girl flinched and held up her hand to Karma,signalling that she was going to check on it.She pressed her ear to the door,trying to pick up sounds with her excellent hearing.Sure enough,she could hear clacking noises,but what was more intriguing was the sound coming from the room was--
"Music?"
Just as Karma was about to barge in,Kyoka help up her hands and hushed,"Wait!I hear...two people,walking around at a fast pace.They seem to be...dancing."Kyoka reported and without hesitation,Karma delivered a kick to the door handle.The sturdy ivory cracked and the lock was successfully picked.With another forceful shove,the door came down and Karma yelled,"NO MORE GAMES YOU COWARD!HIDING BEHIND CROSSROADS EH?NOT A CHANCE!"
The room was filled with rows and shelves of books reaching all the way up to the ceiling.A library,Kyoka guessed as her eyes swivelled to the two people in the room.The lady who was carried by the man bridal-style wore a midnight blue dress,her purple eyes illuminating the library's faint glow.Her auburn hair was tied up in a bun and the man donned on a tailcoat.A golden watch with ivory hints hung proudly beside his watch pocket as a one-lens spectacle shone in the dim light,his black hair swept back and a black cloth on his chest.He smiled and said,"Darlings-"
BOOM
Kyoka and Karma went in for the kill,their weapons hitting the marble flooring.Smoke dusted around them as they hacked and wheezed.The said man tapped his soles gently on the econd floor of the library by the railings,putting the lady down as he tutted,"How can you let La Brava get in the way?Also,why are you fuming?Trying to kill your old man?"Karma grinned maniacally as he rocketed upwards to the second floor landing.Father Disappointment disappeared in another puff of smoke and reappeared at the other side of the second floor landing,while Karma's knife snagged La Brava's dress."Honey!"La Brava wailed as she ran away from Karma."Sorry about this dear."Father Disappointment yelled as he snapped his fingers.Suddenly,a gust of wind whacked La Brava harshly on the neck,causing the said woman to collapse.Karma jumped off the landing,using the suction pads on his gloves and boots to stick to the wall."Once a jerk,always a jerk."Karma hushed as he went in for the kill once more.Kyoka and Karma came up with some strategies while clabering up the hill.Karma is obviously the better fighter among them so he would serve as the distraction.Kyoka can judge a person's next movements thanks to her acute hearing.She crept up behind Father Disappointment with the dagger in hand,striking for the neck--or where the neck was.Father Disappointment disappeared again and reappeared on the first floor,this time in a French suit with a black cloth for a tie and gloves on his hands,a long black cape billowing behind him.If he had to be a hero,he'd be the hero of disappointments."There you are,Kyoka darling!I must say,you've gotten quite good at sneaking around,but still quite noisy!"He disppeared in a puff of smoke,revealing a man behind a white mask with only two holes for eyes.The man wore a black top hat and a black French suit,with a black cape billowing behind him like the hero of disappointments he was.
"The Void?!"
