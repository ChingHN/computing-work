Standing on the very top of the hill was a deserted mansion--no--a haunted mansion.The twins,Jiro and Karma,could only clamber up the hill in order to reach the meeting spot.As weird as it seemed,the twins kew better than to go against their father,but the destination and meeting time was unsetting."H-hey,so do you t-think that h-he will show up?"Jiro muttered,swinging herself up a rocky ledge using the overhanging branch."It does seem quitemstrange since Father was never the type to evem show up.That jerk abandoned us and even when we called him to come home whe Mother was sick and fell ill,he merely sent a "Sorry".The most outraging shit was that according to Melissa who was abroad,she saw Father dating another woman.on't tell me she saw the wrong man,we hung out since we were 3,'Karma spat,glaring at Jiro who wanted to protest.He knew that his sister was a softie and her compassion was overwhelming,even too much at times."10 years later,he comes back to apologisein a shit house.I'll make use of that advantage of the abandoned house.Just you see,sis,I'll have him on his knees in no time.
