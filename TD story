Standing on the very top of the hill was a deserted mansion--no--a haunted mansion.The twins could only clamber up the hill in order to reach the meeting spot.As weird as it seemed,the twins kew better than to go against their father,but the destination and meeting time was unsetting."H-hey,so do you t-think that h-he will show up?"Kyoka muttered,swinging herself up a rocky ledge using the overhanging branch."It does seem quite strange since Father was never the type to evem show up.That jerk abandoned us and even when we called him to come home whe Mother was sick and fell ill,he merely sent a "Sorry".The most outraging shit was that according to Melissa who was abroad,she saw Father dating another woman.Don't tell me she saw the wrong man,we hung out since we were 3,she knows our family well enough,'Karma spat,glaring at Kyoka who wanted to protest.He knew that his sister was a softie and her compassion was overwhelming,even too much at times."10 years later,he comes back to apologise in a shit house.I'll make use of that advantage in the abandoned house.Just you see,sis,I'll have him on his knees in no time."
When the duo clambered to the top of the hill,they saw a 3-floored mansion that stood with ripe dominance.The mansion was made purely of ivory and marble,vines curling up the floors with rusting frames and smashed windows.Kyoka knew very well that Karma would start scouting around the mansion to find the old jerk first.Unfortunately,Karma was not joking about bringing him onto his knees.All this while,Karma had to relinquish his anger on the job,assasinating his targets as cruelly as possible.When faced with his true target,Kyoka has no doubts that he will go straight for hellish torture then the most "artistic" kil.That was the only way to vent his anger rationally and Kyoka could not help him much.She,too, was angry at their old man for his ridiculoius behaviour,but the tiny voice inside her still hopes that this is nothing more than a nightmare...
Karma,who graduated from the assasination class,was obvious;y skilled at hunting and assasination.He came back,signalling his hands in a cross--the old man is inside.He brandished his assasination weapon--a kinfe--while Kyoka took a flashlight out from hr satchel."Don't do that!"Karma hissed,yanking the torchlight and threw it down the mountain."I forgot to teach you the first rule in assasination:always scout your enemies in the dark.You get the surprise factor and attention won't be drawn to you."Karma sighed,fishing out 2 night vision goggles.Kyoka pouted,"At least you ould have said so...you threw my new torchlight down the hill!Who knows if it's still in one piece..."The duo stalked up to the front gates and pushed the door open.Unfortunately,as cunning as the man ever was,he set traps to alert him of their arrival.The front door not only let out a stubborn creak,he added bells to the top of the door.Karma jumped to the top and slashed at the bells,emitting a long chime.He yelled,"Enough with your party tricks!Come out and play1"Kyoka was about to warn him about the laser traps when Karma deftly leapt over the laser traps like a gymnast."Well,come on!"Kyoka tried to follow his moves but ended up sticking to the ground,sliding across the marble flooring to get to the other side of the hall.
